Djikstra's algorithm for shortest path in a graph
====

In this program, I wrote a program in C++ that uses Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. For more information on Djikstra's algorithm, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">Wikipedia's article</a>.

This code compiles with G++.
